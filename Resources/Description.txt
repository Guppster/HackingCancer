HackingCancer is an attempt to create a challenging web applet game in Java with the main purpose of utilizing the power of crowdsourcing to improve cancer research.

This is a Side-Scroller, platformer game in which the user first creates their own map from visual representations of a Gene MicroArray. The user is challenged to determine the path with the most amount of orbs present which would allow them to collect these orbs in the second stage of the game. 

This path is a unautomatable process due to sher amount of data and thus is the bottleneck for scientists in their progression to find a cure for cancer. Allowing users to solve these simple problems has been statistically proven to increase analysis speed by 600% (Jonna Reynolds, Cancer Research UK).

Once the map has been created, the user is placed at the starting point on their own map. The map is populated with many monsters that will kill the user if they touch them to make the game challenging and competitive. Upon reaching the finish line the user is shown their score and the score + the extracted research data is saved online in JSON format for further analysis.
